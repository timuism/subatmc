::Article
  ::Longform
  I'm Timothy <span class="text-gray-600">(he/they)</span>,
  also known as subatmc. I'm an New Afrikan cultural worker
  raised
  & living on Piscataway land.

  While some know me as a software engineer by day, by night
  many know me as bassist that has played with and for many
  projects spanning different genres. I am all of that and
  more. I'd love for you explore some of my original music,
  writing and more!
