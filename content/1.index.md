# üëãüèΩ Peace!

::Article
  ::Longform
  I'm Timothy <span class="text-gray-600">(he/they)</span>. I am an artist, songwriter, bassist, guitarist and producer born, raised and living on Piscataway land (commonly known as Baltimore, MD).

  I write and perform "experimental psychedelic indie" as *subatmc*, and I am also a member of the creative collective [Sages from Earth](https://instagram.com/sagesfromearth).

  While some know me as a software engineer by day, many know me by night as a bassist who has played with and for many projects spanning different genres. I am all of that and more. I‚Äôd love for you to explore some of my original music, writing, and more!
