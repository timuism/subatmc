# 👋🏽 Peace!

  I'm Timothy <span class="text-gray-600">(he/they)</span>, also known as subatmc. I’m an African cultural worker raised and living on Piscataway land.

  While some know me as a software engineer by day, many know me by night as a bassist who has played with and for many projects spanning different genres. I am all of that and more. I’d love for you to explore some of my original music, writing, and more!
