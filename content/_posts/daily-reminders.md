    On October 5, [Sages From Earth](https://www.instagram.com/sagesfromearth) played a free show down at the Baltimore Waterfront to kick off a concert series hosted by [GOOD food](https://www.instagram.com/goodfood410__). It was a good time, we performed songs by yours truly, [Bari Lutalo](https://www.instagram.com/barilutalo), [Winzday Love](https://www.instagram.com/winzdaylove) as well as a few covers with [Chelsea Monae](https://www.instagram.com/chelseamonae). It was a wonderful start to a month that I usually spend reflecting right before I start another trip around the sun.

    But besides that event, ~October~ OcTIMber was pretty uneventful this year. With me spending most of the year in a boot trying to heal an injury of my left foot, I haven't been able to move as much as I would like. This is probably needed. I don't like to slow down! I rarely get bored and I like to always be doing something.

    Maybe that mindset is finally catching up to me. Maybe my drive to never stay still meant I was pushing my body more than I realized. When my feet grew tired I shifted my weight, turned my ankles and shifted my posture; I leaned against walls and rolled my shoulders. What I needed to do was rest.

    The world does not value rest as much as work. Value and worth are intertwined with productivity, labor and skill. Many of us rest to return back to work, to be as productive as possible, and to make sure our output does not decrease. This makes sense, I mean how can you rest if you didn't work? It might seem like a subtle difference, but it is about valuing rest *as much as* we value work. If we value rest as much as we value work, we reduce that chance of overworking ourselves. We can have a *more productive rest*. I think this is a small but important step of liberating one's self from capitalism. Do not feel guilty from taking a break. Take time, make time to do nothing. Make time to more of what you enjoy. I say this myself as much as I say it to you (maybe even more).

    Take care of your bodies. Take care of your feet. The carry all of you and we take them for granted. Take care of your lover's feet kiss them, wash them, massage them.
