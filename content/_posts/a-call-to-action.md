## A Call to Action

I'm writing this on the 190th day of heightened israeli aggression, terror and genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza. Since October 7th over 33 thousand Palestinians have been killed with more than 13,000 of them being children.

It is easy to feel like there is nothing that can be done to help but that isn't true.

If you are able to do so, please donate! With social media, there are people that are directly purchasing food, products, services and necesities.
