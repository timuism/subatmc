I just want to define goals and share them here. Please hold me accountable by shooting my messages on facebook, and letting me know that you are looking forward to what I am working on (assuming that you are, of course).

### goals:
- 2 new songs released this spring
- 1 subatmc set in the spring time
- preview some of this story that I am writing, called "M."
- keep up with this journal
- keep up with my reading list (finish black marxist in the next 2 weeks)

Besides the last goal about finish Black Marxist, all of these goals should be completed by the Summer.

follow me on insta: @subatmc, lets connect!
